Vancouver
In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have
(1) .... up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents
(2) .... down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at
almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting

opportunities. And (3) .... some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have (4) .... ,
there's no doubt that the new arrivals and (5) .... tourism industry have helped fuel an urban

Putting Pen to Paper

believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that (8) .... in our work, we
are always (9) .... to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter (10) .... 
us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may re-
write a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent 
grasp of the effect of his words that there (11) .... the only sure test of the real artist. When 
Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he (12) .... never thought consciously that it was the 
contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great 
writer.

Supermarket Opening
The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely

ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are (13) .... up every day in many areas and so the poor
old celebrity has become (14) ..... Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will 
open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of 
Superbuy, (15) .... they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew 
someone who worked there, the first five men over the (16) .... would be getting a bottle of 
aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This (17) .... of information quickly swept 
(18) .... the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority among those at the front, and envy from 
the latecomers.
