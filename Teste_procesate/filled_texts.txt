Survive as a driver
Does the thought of having your driving licence taken (0) .... from you not bear thinking about? Now that there are more
sophisticated detection techniques being employed by the police to catch speeding motorists, the chances of you losing
your licence have significantly increased. From time to time, all of us creep over the speed limit. If caught, we face the risk of
a heavy fine, penalty points or, worst of all, losing our licence altogether. In this way, the authorities are able to take away
your means of transport, freedom and money. Prosecuting speeding motorists is an unbeatable way of generating cash
for the government, as the motorist is an easy target and a good source of income. He's easier to catch than a thief, is
less troublesome when caught and can probably come up with the money to pay a substantial fine. Fight back now. Send
for your trial copy of How to survive as a driver and shorten the odds of getting caught in a speed trap. We'll show you how.

The Spy Who Loved Me
When she found the letter, she was (0) ..... Here she was, living for years under the illusion that her husband was a CIA
operative, only to find out that he was, in fact , a travelling salesman, selling encyclopedias around the backwaters of the
Mississippi delta. Their life together had been a humdrum one, he away for weeks at a time 'on missions', she keeping house
and getting the children off to school. It hadn't been a problem before, though, because he had insisted this was a(n)
necessary evil, a front for him to hide behind. So there was always that element of excitement, secrecy, and there were his stories
on his return. He could certainly spin a yarn, she had to give him that. Tales of plots, kidnappings, secret signs and
assassination attempts. Midnight calls from the President, summoning him to the White House. At first, he flatly denied
it, but when she confronted him with the evidence, he broke down in tears.

PECKING ORDER
It may well be that, (0) .... from the obvious needs like eating and drinking - the basic survival necessities - the strongest
urge people have is to fit in. If you observe the behaviour of a group of strangers put together in a room to complete a
given task, you will find that above and beyond the actual work that gets done - the organising, the delegation and so on
and so forth - a more subtle shuffling is taking place. In families, in groups of friends, roles are., to a large extent .. already
assigned and accepted (if sometimes grudgingly ), but with a new group each individual must find their place in that particular
collection. Most interestingly, if we contrast the efficiency of the group before and after this settling in, we notice a marked
difference. Once the group falls into roles, it always outperforms how it did formerly; unsurprisingly, perhaps, since it is
no longer a bunch of strangers chosen at random , but a team.

The School Contract
We require pupils of Morton Public School to (0) .... by the rules laid out below. Once you have read them, please sign
your name on the dotted line and hand the form in to your house master. Any infringement of the rules in the future will then be
entirely your responsibility.
Smoking is strictly forbidden for all pupils except those in the sixth form, who are asked to restrict their smoking to their
common room and bedrooms. Consumption of alcohol on the school premises is not permitted under any circumstances; this
offence is punishable by instant expulsion. While you are in the uniform of Morton Public School, you are expected to behave
in a manner that does your school credit This means gentlemanly behaviour, smartness of dress and politeness of
speech. At all times, bear in mind that while you are in school uniform you are a representative of this school.

Etiquette
Miss Maud (0) .... a tiny, nearly imperceptible sigh. She had never been a particularly patient person, but lately she had
found herself becoming bitterly resentful of anyone who wasted her time. These dinner parties, she decided, had never been
particularly enjoyable; her youth alone had given her the energy and vitality necessary to rise above the bores and the
drone of inconsequential chatter. There was nothing wrong with small talk as long as it led somewhere, developed into
deeper conversation or light-hearted banter. Not meaningless politenesses that were piled one on top of the other, on and
on. She was so tense, in fact, that whenever Mrs Pitt offered her a plate of - whatever it was this time - she had to clench
her teeth together for fear she'd give her a tongue-lashing no one would be likely to forget. And none of them seemed to
care, have the slightest idea. Colonel Roberts was listing his racehorses, one by one, and how each had done in its last
five races. Priscilla Dorkins, supposedly the beauty of the bunch (not that the competition was up to much) was telling
her neighbour (who was all ears) exactly how to tie a hair ribbon, and the consequences of getting it wrong.

The Geneva Convention
The Geneva Convention is the name given to a (0) .... of international treaties dealing with the behaviour of nations that
are waging war on one another. The initiative came from the Swiss philanthropist Henri Dunant, who had already been
inspired to found the International Red Cross after seeing the horrific neglect of wounded soldiers on the battlefield of
Solferino in 1859.
After World War Two, due to the atrocities that occurred, it was deemed necessary to update and ratify the treaties, which
fell into four parts. The first two dealt with the treatment of sick and wounded combatants (one for land war and one for
sea); the third, the treatment of prisoners of war and the last that of civilians in time of war.
Almost every nation signed, but a 1977 extension of the convention to include guerrillas fighting for self-determination or in
civil wars was signed only by about half. Conspicuous by their absence were the UK and the USA.

Belize
Belize is a tiny Central American country with a big (0) ..... Located on the east coast of the isthmus facing the Caribbean
Sea, it's population is just 250,000 people and it has two cities; Belize City on the coast and Belmopan, which was constructed
in 1970 after a hurricane and subsequent tidal wave laid waste to the old capital.
The decades-old tension between Belize and neighbouring Guatemala seems to have eased , allowing Belize to
concentrate on developing and promoting its tourist industry. It is a wise choice, for it is the gem of Central America.
There have been tight controls on logging in its forests, meaning practically half remain intact - a unique achievement in
Central America. In addition, the second largest coral reef in the world lies in its coastal waters and is home to a vast
array of marine life.

Royal Jelly
Honey was the first sweetener, and formed the (0) .... of what was probably the first alcoholic beverage (mead, no doubt
created accidentally when food was preserved in honey for the winter). There is evidence that Stone Age humans were
beekeepers, keeping swarms in crude wooden hives.
Bees collect nectar from flowers, which they convert from sucrose into fructose and glucose to produce honey. It is used
to feed the bee larvae after they reach the tender age of three days.
Prior to that they are fed with a mysterious substance called royal jelly, but after it is only for those who are destined .. to be
queens. A larva thus fed wi ll emerge ready to fight and attempt to drive off the old queen and any other rivals. To the
victor goes the hive; the rest must leave to form colonies elsewhere.

Over the Top?
A magistrate responded to a (0) .... of graffiti attacks in Ripley town centre by ordering eighteen-year-old Brian Jobs to be
jailed for six months, a sentence condemned by the accused's lawyer, Gordon Tone, as 'grossly unfair'.
The magistrate, Lawson Merton, defended his action, claiming that offenders had begun to act as if they were 'above the
law'. His harsh sentencing, he said, was intended to 'send out a message that a sea change is taking place in
courtrooms and offenders should no longer expect the softly-softly approach to continue. I am making an example of this
boy,' he said bluntly.
The offender's mother, Iris Jobs, was horrified. 'If you want to put .. your foot down, why do it with someone who threw
a bit of paint around?' She strongly hinted at the magistrate having an ulterior motive; one of the targets of her son's spray
can was Merton's new sports car.

In Brief
Police in Monkton are appealing for (0) .... who might be able to shed some light on the art installations that have been
appearing around the city centre for some weeks now. Shoppers have been presented with, among other things: a dinner table
set with plates, cutlery and glasses; a mannikin on a skateboard, a banana balanced on its head; a bicycle seemingly
suspended in mid-air, complete with a model of E.T. in its basket.
Responding to the suggestion that it was no more than harmless fun, Police Superintendent Martin Fulchester responded,
'First of all, to practise any kind of art in public, you must have a licence. Secondly, if one of these things fell, it could
cause an injury, and who would we hold responsible? And finally, some of the offerings were not so innocent. The statue
of Mayor Tinsel recently had a false beard attached to it, and a sign round its neck reading "All bribes gratefully received".
Now, the mayor's been dead fifty years, but if he was alive ... '

The changing role of librarians
A combination of new technology and shifting student expectations is (0) .... !:: .... altering the job
of a college or university librarian. Many librarians now regard themselves as information brokers
who facilitate and manage access to the information resources needed for learning, teaching and
research. They agree that the pace of change has accelerated and much more content is delivered
electronically.
As a result of this, a librarian's responsibilities include information technology, knowledge
management and institutional portals, in addition to being excellent managers and interpreters of
services which may be provided from a growing range of global resources. Despite tremendous
changes within library environments, these challenges are regarded as stimulating. Librarians
respond by being flexible and adaptable in establishing a strong customer focus , requiring the
expansion of their skills to providing support to internet users and delivering e-services. Nevertheless ,
most librarians say that many traditional library skills are still applicable in the digital world.

Scientists and communication
Scientists are often accused of being poor communicators, yet there are many reasons why
scientists, (0) .... !"! .. .. , should be and often are good communicators. After all, science calls
for enthusiasm and scientists often possess this engaging quality in large quantities.
Enthusiasm can be infectious, but to command the interest of readers, scientists must develop their
other innate talents: clarity, observation and knowledge.
Those scientists who are logical thinkers can usually write clearly, and the more clearly thoughts
are put across , the greater their potential value. In the same way, those who observe must take
account of subtle differences for the observations they may document as significant. Finally, those
who write must have something of intrinsic value to say.
A scientist whose work never sees the light of day has achieved nothing of worth until somebody
else hears about it. It is essential, therefore, for scientists to lay to rest the myth that
they cannot communicate, once and for all.

Nothing is impossible
Law firm Matthews and Reynolds is a (0) .. <;. ... example of a business using art to revamp its public
image. The firm hired an advertising agency called Eyeopener to carry out a rebranding exercise .
and gave the agency free rein to take the company by the scruff of the neck and effect a major
makeover. The firm wanted smart, contemporary imagery which would symbolise an innovative,
forward-thinking business.
As a result the firm now has a new logo, and all its advertising material features clever modern images
which are easy on the eye. Director Alan Ross comments: 'The images Eyeopener came up with say
a lot about our approach, size and experience. And we were delighted with the advertising campaign
they subsequently devised , using a stylish, sophisticated approach with a touch of humour here
and there.'
Public response to the rebranding has been excellent, and what appeared to be a dusty old law
firm has been given a new lease of life as an adventurous and confident concern.

Photography at its most daring
Photographers who have (0) .... P. .... so close to volcanoes that their clothes started to burn, come
within stroking distance of tigers in the wild, or dived under sea ice in freezing cold water have
joined forces for an exhibition, billed as displaying images from the harshest places on
Earth
Polar bears and seals were captured on camera by a photographer who grew up in the Arctic
and trained as a marine biologist. He dives under sea ice to swim with his subjects, once
offending a leopard seal by refusing the penguin she tried to feed him with. Another exhibitor has
recorded not only tigers but also chimpanzees that had never before encountered human beings.
The volcano enthusiasts work in fireproof suits, always at risk of becoming so transfixed by the
beauty of the eruptions that they venture too close. There are invisible pockets of gas as well as
flames, all of which contribute to the deadly perils of being an extreme photographer.

England's breakfast revolution
The importance of a good breakfast is beyond (0) ........... according to health experts, but in
historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast
seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly , there are scattered references to travellers
having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to
breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs
or nobles.
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm , not the exception. Some
writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not
always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment
may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast,
as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved
starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted ~ .. in
necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.

The way we see the things around us
'Pastry,' once wrote a cookery expert, 'like horses and children, seems to (0) .......... if you are
afraid of it and plays up accordingly ......... ' Had she been writing today, she might well have mentioned that
computers are just the same. Like small children, they do not respond well to force, and just as
one way of dealing with a fractious child is to send it to its room to cool ........ off, so quite often,
if the machine is giving trouble, the first thing to try is simply switching it off and doing something
else; quite why the machine works perfectly when you boot it up again I have no idea.
Attributing human emotions and feelings to inanimate objects is, of course, extremely unscientific;
it's only those who don't understand machines who believe that they behave like people. But I
would maintain that, although treating machines like people may be misguided, it is preferable ,
in general, to treating people like machines.

A Cosmic Directory
Scientists at Puerto Rico University in Arecibo have recently (0) ......... a cosmic directory that lists
the planets and moons most likely to harbour alien life. They created the catalogue to make sense
of the ever-increasing number of distant worlds that are visible with modern telescopes. They
believe it will help astronomers, and others with an interest, to compare faraway worlds and keep
tabs ..... on the most habitable ones as researchers discover them.
The catalogue ranks the habitability of planets and moons according to three criteria : their
surface temperature, their similarity to Earth and their capacity to sustain organisms that
lurk at the bottom of the food chain. It suggests that among hundreds of candidates, only
a few planets are potentially habitable, and gives high scores for habitability to even fewer. The
database also holds information on the location of the planets, their probable mass and the type
and age of the stars they orbit.

The importance of saving plastic
Many artefacts of (0) .......... cultural significance from the last century were made from plastic.
It was always confidently assumed that this rather mundane material was virtually
indestructible. Now that some of these artefacts have become museum pieces , we have
discovered that this notion was sadly mistaken.
The degradation of plastics is worrying both scientists and historians, who are racing against
time to save our plastic heritage before it crumbles into dust. Our love affair with plasti_cs
stems in large part from the fact they can be moulded into just about any shape imaginable.
When it comes to longevity, however, they have a serious flaw : their chemical structure
breaks down when they are exposed to air and sunlight.
Many now argue that we must consider the cultural legacy we will be leaving future
generations. Without urgent intervention .. ...... many artefacts will be lost forever. But developing
effective conservation strategies is difficult because what works to preserve one type of plastic
can have a catastrophic effect on the lifespan of another.

Australian Cinema
Thirty years ago, the New Australian cinema (0) ... .Jt ... the attention of the world with heroic stories set
in the !ate-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. They were tales of the formation of a national
identity , of the recent settlers transactions with their strange new world and its frighteningiy mystical
inhabitants. When this vein was exhausted , local film makers left home or turned to the problematic
present of people living lives of noisy desperation in the sprawling suburbs of the big coastal cities,
home to most Austraiians. As television series, these cosy, unheroic stor1es achieved worldwide
popularity, but re!ative!y few films of this sort have found success elsewhere, except for a small
{5) ........... among which are these highly accomplished and caiculatedly theatrical films. They are
loving assemblages of conventions .. .. . . . . . . and cliches from the musicals of the past, produced with an
exuberance that sweeps the audience up in uncriticai enjoyment.

Making The Magnificent Seven
Aklra Kurosawa's 1954 classic Seven Samurai is about a (0) ... .8 ..... of down-on-their-luck warriors who
agree to defend a small village from a band of thieves in exchange for three meals a day and much
honour. Since Kurosawa's major influence was the epic Westerns of John Ford, it is ironic that
in 1959 Hollywood thought Samurai would make a good cowboy film and The Magnificent Seven
appeared on the screen. Originally, Yul Brynner was to direct the remake but after much argument ,
director John Sturges took the helm Aside from Broadway actor Eli Wallach, Brynner was the
oniy famous name in the movie; Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Vaughn and James Coburn
got their career changing roles by word of mouth. Now, in this digitaliy rejigged version you can
find out what happened on the action-filled set via an exclusive new documentary and how the fi!m
nearly did not become the revered classic it is today.

The Rothschilds
When, in the 18th century, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (0) ..... B .... his studies to join a banking firm in
his native Frankfurt, he took the first steps towards creating one of the most successful, and most
influentiai, banks.
For nearly two centuries, the fortunes of the British government and those of the bank were
fundamentally !inked Thanks to the Rothschilds, the Duke of Wellington was able to pay his army
in 1814-15 (the bank received a 2% commission on the deal). Ten years later, the Rothschilds again
came to the (3} ........... when 145 British banks faiied, helping prevent the collapse of the whole UK
banking system.
The 19th century Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, believed one of his great political coups to be
the acquisition of enough shares in the Suez Cana! to secure Britain a controliing interest Again,
thanks to a £4 million Rothschild loan. Today, the company ranks among the world's largest
privately owned banks, with 40 offices in 30 different countries.

Michael Faraday
Michael Faraday was one of the most (0) ...... A .. scientists in the entire history of science. One of his
inventions, a dynamo, is regarded as a forerunner of modern power genenerators.
Despite having little in the way of formal education, Faraday was a prodigious reader and autodidact
and soon came to the attention of the scientific estabiishment. He first set forth on the path
of his professional life as assistant to the renowned scientist Sir Humphrey Davy. Although working for
Sir Davy brought Faraday into contact . . .. .. . . . with many scientists, he also had to endure class
discrimination and was regarded as little more than a servant by the Davy famiiy. It was perhaps due
to their mistreatment that Faraday rejected the offer of the presidency of the Royal Society out of
hand in later life.
Apart from his scientific breakthroughs, Faraday was involved in many projects for the British
government. One of the projects he undertook was to investigate coal mine explosions. Unfortunately,
the government deemed his report inconclusive and it was to be another 60 years before his warnings
were heeded.

Gold
Almost every culture in the world has valued goid in its various forms and sought it as a (0) .... .13... ..
metal, either to worship or to trade in. A symbol of power and success, the desire to own it tends to
provoke both greed and lust. Its very presence can make or break a nation. The esteem
associated with it has driven mankind to great lengths to obtain it. And the great gold rushes of
the 19th century saw hundreds of thousands die in an attempt to strike it rich. Despite declining
gold prices and uncertainties in the market, as countries such as Australia and Britain sell off large
portions of their gold reserves , the desire to find go!d is as strong as ever. In the US, panning for
gold has become a huge leisure industry, where once men slogged and slaved for the glitter of gold,
families now go out for a picnic while looking for gold. However, foi most, it is still only the stuff .
of dreams.

Hi Tech Cricket
The Hawk-eye system has made a great deal of (0) .... C. ... to the sports of tennis and cricket in recent
years. The system, which is a good example of how military technology can be used for peaceful
purposes , is based on missile tracking technology. The system works by placing high speed cameras
at different iocations and angles around the cricket fieid or area of play and using the data
provided by the cameras to analyse the trajectory of a ball to help cricket and tennis umpires make
accurate decisions. It is especially useful for such difficult decisions as LBW in cricket (leg before
wicket) when the umpire must determine whether the bali would have hit the stumps had the batsman's
leg not got in the way. Modern bowlers deliver the bali at such incredible speeds that umpires can
have difficulty in foliowing the bali with the naked eye.
The software in the system can predict with an accuracy of 5mm the direction of a ball and at the
same time collect statistical data on the height the ba!I and the speed it travelled at. This means that
fiercely disputed decisions in tennis and cricket can be definitively settled.

Sharing a Room
Before starting university, I hadn't given more than a (0) .......... ~ .......... thought to what could go wrong
sharing a room with another student. I had simply assumed that my roommate-to-be would be rather
like me - at university to have fun but mainly to learn. Within a couple of weeks, I was all too ..
aware that my fun-loving Scottish roommate, Thomas, was at university to do a great deal of the former
but very little of the latter .
Every evening, I would be tucked up in bed by midnight, exhausted from the day's activities. But the
midnight hour was precisely when Thomas' night began. First, a constant stream of people
would start traipsing in and out of our room until a general consensus had been reached on how the
night would best be spent Next, preparations for the night would ensue; phone calls would
be made, outfits chosen. If I was lucky, Thomas would be gone by 1 :30am. But by 6:30am, he and two
or three of his mates would be back, keen to dissect the night's activities. At which point, the
smile I always endeavoured to plaster firmly on my face would be wearing dangerously thin.
Despite all this, Thomas and I remained firm friends throughout university. Although I do
confess that our friendship was helped along .............. rather a lot by the fact that we both found new
roommates before the first month was out!

Young at Heart
Sociologists suggest certain cultures have almost (0) .......... ~.......... the word 'old' from their
vocabulary. Linguistically speaking, people are just not allowed to be old anymore. At a(n)
push they can be 'elderly', but more often than not they are 'senior citizens', 'older adults'
or one of a host of other euphemisms.
It's true that grandparents these days, while not necessarily younger in years than those of past
generations, are definitely younger in spirit. One is increasingly hard pressed to find a sixtysomething
sitting quietly at home watching TV, waiting for the grandchildren to call round. No, today's
over-sixties are out and about. They are socialising, running marathons, travelling the
world. They look better than ever, are more independent than ever, and even put many
twenty-somethings to shame when it comes to fitness.
Clearly, there is much to be said for this development. Society can no longer mindlessly
relegate its elderly to the scrap heap. Still, the expectation for youthful vigour in the elderly
does have its downsides. The prerogatives of the over-sixties since time immemorial -
aching joints, reduced energy, mental fogginess - are becoming increasingly unacceptable. Nowadays,
to actually behave as though you are in your twilight years is almost frowned upon.

Risotto
Although pasta usually grabs the (0) .......... !? .......... when it comes to Italian cooking, rice is also a
common staple found on tables across Italy. Indeed, whereas southern Italians eat pasta every day
without fail , northern Italians eat risotto: a dish of rice and various other ingredients cooked
slowly in a rich stock until creamy in consistency .
The history of risotto is naturally tied to the history of rice in Italy. Rice probably arrived on
the peninsula sometime during the 10th century, brought to Sicily by Arab conquerors. Agriculturally,
Italy turned out to be perfect for cultivating rice. The lie of the land, the availability
of water, and the Mediterranean humidity is just right for growing the short-grained rice varieties that
are essential for a risotto.
It was in the Lombardia, Veneta, and Piemonte regions of Northern Italy in the 15th century that rice
met its destiny. Slow-cooking dominated the culinary landscape of the region. These slowcooking
principles, combined with the local rice and rich flavours and spices for which the area was
known, created risotto. A quintessential Italian dish, risotto is Northern Italy's famous and much-loved
contribution to the world's cuisine.

The Irish Potato Famine
The Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1850 was one of the worst calamities ever to .......... ~ .......... Ireland.
Just five short years of famine ...................... Ireland's population plummet by a quarter, as one
million people starved to death and another million fled the country and went abroad.
By the mid 1800s, one third of Ireland's population was entirely dependent on potatoes for
nourishment. Sporadic potato crop failures were a regular feature of Irish life, but the blight
which struck Ireland's potato crop in i845 was so severe it (4} ...................... all others. Caused by the
fungus Phytophthora infestans, the blight turned potatoes into a slimy, decaying, blackish 'mass of
rottenness'. In i845 the blight claimed one third of Ireland's potato crop; in i8461 one half;
then, in i847, Ireland's entire potato crop failed.
The result was human and cultural catastrophe. Whole counties were almost entirely depopulated. The
Gaelic language nearly died out Today, many historians regard the Irish Potato Famine as a
major turning point in Ireland's history as, after it, Ireland's demographic, political, and cultural
landscape was changed forever.

Mt Vesuvius
Mention Italy's legendary volcano, Vesuvius, to most people and the image that will (0) ........ ..!?.. ....... .
to their minds is the famous eruption of 79 AD that wiped out the Roman cities of Pompeii and
Herculaneum. But, according to some experts who consider the volcano the most dangerous in the
world, Vesuvius may well awaken sometime in the near future with even more catastrophic
results. The prospect, which could spell disaster for the three million people who live in the
immediate vicinity of the volcano, has stirred up vigorous debate among scientists and civil
authorities on how to prepare for such an event.
A key issue is the likely scale of future eruptions. Many geologists believe Vesuvius is due
a massive eruption. Others argue that the eruptive nature of Vesuvius has changed over time, and that
smaller eruptions are now the norm Any disaster preparation planning depends entirely
on which scenario civil authorities choose as their basis. Currently, authorities have a plan in
place that will allow the 600,000 people living at Vesuvius's base to be evacuated seventytwo
hours ahead of an impending eruption. But no plan exists for a worst case scenario event: a
massive eruption which would demand the evacuation of all three million of Naples' residents.

Bubble Tea
Bubble tea is the latest drinks craze to (0) ......... A .......... the UK, but will the craze last? First
...................... first: bubble tea is milky, iced tea with small, chewy balls of tapioca dropped into the
cup. It was invented in tea shops in Taiwan during the 1980s, but it is now popular in countries all over
the world. We Brits have been fairly late in catching on to the craze, but that's probably because
of our weather. The idea of a cold bubble tea may appeal in hot and humid Taiwan, but a
steaming mug of hot chocolate is more the order of the day in wet and windy Britain. Still, better
...................... than never; bubble tea is now being served in shops throughout Britain.
So, what's it like? Online reviews of UK bubble tea shops are mixed Some say the bubble
tea in the UK isn't like the authentic Taiwanese stuff. Others rave about it. The opinion of this reviewer?
Well, drinking bubble tea is fun. It's kind of a meal in a drink: the tapioca balls are chewy and filling,
while the tea is refreshing and sweet. Britain may not have the perfect climate all year round .
for enjoying cold drinks, but bubble tea could still conceivably take off. Obviously, it won't replace
the traditional British habits of tea and coffee drinking. But there could well be a place for
it somewhere in the afternoon, or during weekend shopping.

Appalachia
Steep green wooded hills with alpine meadows, (0) ...................... to their sides stretched away for 
as far as the eye could see. Before me a sinuous road led down to a valley of rolling farms 
spread out along a lazy river. It was as perfect a setting as I had ever seen. I 
drove through the soft light of dusk, absorbed by the beauty.
This was the heart of Appalachia, the most severely impoverished region of the United 
States. Known for its music, and also known historically, and largely unjustly, for its isolation, for coal 
mining, and for the dearth of education of its inhabitants, it is also one of the most misunderstood 
regions. But to my eye above all else, it was simply inexpressibly beautiful.
It seemed strange to think that the urban professionals of the Eastern Seaboard cities hadn’t 
colonised an area of such arresting beauty, filling the dales with rustic weekend cottages, 
country clubs and fancy restaurants. At a second glance however, there were a handful 
of quaint cottages dotted among the farms. Perhaps Appalachia was on the cusp of 
establishing a new identity.

Benefit Fraud
Once or twice a year, William Hitt, a top class (0) ...................... C ............ artist, dressed up to play the
part of a severely disabled man. According to authorities, he often went
so far as to strap on an arm brace and sit in a wheelchair during visits to the benefit office. Hitt
had claimed that an injury to his right hand, and the subsequent bungled treatment
using bone from his leg, had left him in considerable pain, unable to walk, and in need
of constant assistance.
The Criminal and Financial Investigation team, who began investigating Hitt last year after they
were tipped off that he was conning the authorities into thinking that he was disabled,
estimate that his fraudulent claims amount to more than £400,000 in the form of
housing benefits, aid from the Independent Living Fund, income support and disability living
allowance.
The evidence against Hitt, presented at his trial, included photos of him shopping, video
filmed by the Metropolitan Police of him walking unaided, as well as a video of him dancing at a
wedding. At Isleworth Crown Court, he was convicted of 12 counts of fraud, including
deception and making false statements.

Singapore

Singapore is a young and diverse country. It has (0) ...................... C .......... from only about
a thousand residents in the early 1800s to more than 5 million today. Around 40 percent
of the populace is foreign-born and there are four official languages: English,
Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Religions are even more numerous . Indeed, racial and
religious harmony is regarded by the government to be essential, and a part of the
national identity.
Singaporeans tend to consider their nation an outpost of progress in an untidy world – a
19th century English colonial outlook transposed into a ‘modern’ Asia grounded
on hard work and intelligence. That’s understandable, for Singapore is an object lesson
in how to set national priorities – and follow through on them
year upon year. Healthcare and Education are consistently good when compared
globally, and its economy has been called one of the freest, most innovative, most
competitive and most business-friendly.
From an inhospitable swampland has emerged a modern affluent city-state – part
financial services centre, part hi-tech manufacturer, part trading hub to its less developed
neighbours. Few doubt that, by the end of the decade, living standards in
Singapore will be on a par with any country in the world.

ENVIRONMENTAL PHOTOGRAPHY
Many of the species that survive the current (0) ........A......... of extinctions, perpetrated by man's
destruction of the world's natural landscape, will be quasi-domesticated residents of wildlife
preserves. Their original wilderness will be reproduced as tiny enclaves, landscaped by foam rocks
and bounded by walls of iron.
Recognising this, I have no desire to perpetuate the romantic mirages of traditional wildlife
photography. Instead, I create images of animals in their new reality, from that lost Eden, stranded
on a small planet quickly becoming alien to them. It is a new kind of landscape, one largely
devoid of typical topography, but it is the place they must now reside.
Some of the photographic techniques I have used to symbolise that new landscape have been
borrowed from contemporary advertising photography, whose contrived perfection is
aimed at creating desire for superfluous goods such as cosmetics and high-fashion clothing.
In a sense, the use of these techniques is a(n) ironic commentary on our society, which
is so adept at turning the meaningless into the priceless. I hope my photographs challenge us to
revise our perceptions enough to separate the truly priceless from the meaningless.

Origins of the Net
The Internet, as a (0) ........D........, is actually older than most of its users; born, as it was, in
the sixties. While there is no doubting that the Net's claim to fame today is the
quantum leap in global communications it has fostered, the idea of the Net was
not, in fact, hatched in a bid to make information easily accessible to everyone, but
rather in a contest for world domination.
Following the Soviet successes in beating the US into space, the US Department of Defence
formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Twelve years later the ARPA
spawned ARPAnet, the world's first decentralised computer network.
The driving force behind decentralisation, ironically, was bomb-proofing. Hit a
mainframe and the system goes down But bombing a network would, at worst,
only remove one or two nodes. The remainder could route around it unharmed.
At the time of its inception, its creators would likely have been greatly perturbed at the
prospect of its anarchic extension into the public domain.

An Australian Name
The name I answered to in my early years was Vivian James. Later on, my mother gave me the
choice of first names and I picked Clive out of a Tyrone Power movie. She sympathised with the
fix she had (0) ........B......... me into by naming me after Vivian McGrath, one of the
1938 Davis Cup squad. After Vivian Leigh played Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone with the Wind", the
name became irrevocably a girl's name no matter how you spelled it, so those few little
boys who had been saddled with it at birth were unintentionally put through an ordeal
Perhaps it made us stronger. Research indicates that it at least increases levels of self control –
we might not fight more but we learn early to let things roll off our backs,
Likewise experts opine that names, good or bad, don't matter much provided people
have anything else to base their impressions on. inclined
This could be a good thing, or a bad thing. Australians are still offspring to give their

may by unlikely to (9) .................. their famous namesakes, they are equally unlikely to be
judged in the future if their namesake should become unpopular.

Equine Superstar
(0) .......... their two-legged counterparts in the world of sport, horses that become household names are few
and far between. Indeed, it might be claimed that only the names Seattle Slew in the US and Red Rum in
the UK had truly permeated the confines of the racing world to capture the public's imagination before 2012.
That was the year when Frankel made his mark and catapulted the sport of horseracing into the
spotlight. As his victories became more impressive, the interest in him mounted to such a degree that his
exploits made front page news. Before his final race, in which he was attempting to keep his unbeaten
record intact, there were doubts he would handle the very soft ground, which favoured a highly regarded
French rival. However, as racing history shows, these fears proved groundless as Frankel cruised past Cirrus
Des Aigles to confirm he was a racehorse the likes of which we will probably never see again.

Visiting Antarctica
For those intrepid travellers who wish to explore every (0) .......... of the globe, Antarctica, which is still
considered to be off the beaten track , is likely to be high on the list of must-visit destinations. This vast
white wilderness attracts around 35,000 visitors per year, but the experience of marvelling at the diversity
of wildlife and stunning scenery does not come cheap. A typical passenger on a specially adapted ship
can expect to fork out at least £4,000, but if price is no object , there are far more expensive alternatives.
Travel agents' clients who prefer to take off into the more remote interior can stay in opulent camps that
are dismantled at the end of the season. The price tag for such a stay can reach £20,000.
No matter what kind of visit is selected, the Antarctic never fails to deliver on its promise of the holiday
of a lifetime on the most sparsely populated land mass on the planet.

Hype
Several weeks before the (0) .......... of a new film, or the launch of a new product, the marketing magicians
go into overdrive. They whet the appetites of potential consumers with an advertising campaign that convinces
the target market that what they are promoting is a must see, have or do entity. This is accomplished by using
hype, which despite having negative connotations , almost invariably succeeds in boosting sales.
Given that hype is widely known to involve both exaggeration and falsification, it is rather interesting
that people are so readily hoodwinked by the marketing strategists' representations. It is as if they want to
believe the illusion will somehow create a peak of happiness to revive their flat-lining emotions. Whether
that joy is real or imaginary is of little consequence since the stimulation that occurs in the brain is, to all
intents and purposes , the same.
So, it is not merely a case of hype fooling the consumer time and again , but one in which it signposts a
way to escape the drudgery of daily routine. As such, hype guides consumers to a product that may fulfil ..
their needs and consumer behaviour gives credence to the existence of hype. It is a symbiotic relationship.

Cyber Bully
Before the advent of social networking, a school bully was more (0) .......... than not a physically imposing
individual with low self-esteem who positively enjoyed causing pain and suffering. Together with his cronies,
he would actively seek out those he could intimidate without any fear of getting a taste of his own
medicine from a victim's older brother or relative. To avoid losing money, a packed lunch or beating, the bully's
target had to take evasive action by giving his tormentor a wide berth at all times.
Nowadays there is a new breed of tormentor - the cyber bully. Although these people do not have to
meet the physical requirements of their predecessors, they can easily impose substantial psychological
damage on those they set their sights on. What is more, there is no hiding place for the victims as
they become an object of derision and ridicule for every member of the virtual community who has seen an
incriminating image or read a damning accusation.
This insidious use of social networks is just one example of the harm they can do. As a result, many observers
are not yet prepared to sing their praises without reservation.

Personality and Preference
'You can't (0) ..... ..... a book by its cover' goes the saying, and if the frequency of its use is anything to go
by, there are plenty of people willing to vouch for its validity. However, it might be that this saying requires
modification since several psychological studies have revealed strong associations between personality traits ..
and aesthetic tastes. Although researchers have guarded against making sweeping generalisations, they can, to
a fair extent, establish links between an individual's characteristics and preferences with regard to media.
Through extensive research, psychologists have determined that someone who is social is likely to gravitate
towards songs, magazines and television shows in the public eye . Alternatively, those who are highly .
emotional will probably turn to culture and art for comfort or distraction. Thus, personality holds tremendous
sway over what a person reads, listens to or watches. So, given these findings, adding 'but the cover of the book
reflects the personality of its reader' might make it more complete.

History
In spite of their best (O) .......... , historians have been unable to report history without incorporating
elements of bias and selection into their accounts. This inability to eliminate any subjective input has given
rise to doubts about the reliability of our knowledge of past events.
Such distortion of the truth occurred during a recent episode of 'Storage Wars' on the History Channel.
In this particular episode, a young couple made the highest bid for an abandoned storage locker
containing two safes. In the safes, there were a number of coins, one of which was a 1933 Double Eagle that
came with a certificate of authenticity. later in the programme, while they were having the coins appraised,
no mention of the gold coin was made. As a result, the couple were said to have made a profit of a few
thousand dollars, which was far too low an estimate as the last 1933 Double Eagle sold at auction fetched .
over $7 million. This omission may have been justified for a number of reasons, but it certainly led viewers
up the garden path.

Mind Control
Over forty years ago, when the plug was (0) ........ on an infamous government-run project on mind control,
there was a collective sigh of relief. Now, nearly half a century later, new research into meddling with .
people's minds is causing concern that advanced mind-control techniques may be used for sinister purposes.
Though such fears may be warranted, there are simpler mind manipulation techniques that lie much
closer to home. One such technique involves offering an incentive in the form of cash or a sense of
belonging. It is probably the oldest trick in the book, but it can be just as effective as chemicals or brain
implants. Another less sophisticated way to exert influence requires the introduction of a stimulus into
the environment when the desired beliefs are being triggered. This method is particularly effective when the
stimulus, such as a casual remark, seems natural.
The shutdown of one government project did not mark the end of mind control as it is part and parcel of
daily life. However, with the new research being so promising, advanced techniques may be about to take
manipulation to a whole new level.

Greenhouse Gas Alert
Friday 10 May 2013 was a climate (0) ....... in human history. It was the day when data released by the carbon
dioxide monitoring stations at Mauna Loa revealed that the greenhouse gas had reached its highest level for
more than three million years. The 400 ppm barrier , which was last broken during the Pliocene era, is
regarded as an indication that the increase in global average temperature is approaching the
point of no return.
Although the catastrophic consequences of climate change do not appear to be just round the corner ,
various regions across the world are already feeling the effects of rising temperatures. Wet and cold spells
during European summers, for example, have been linked to changes in the high-level jet stream winds
caused by melting sea ice in the Arctic, which has now shrunk to its lowest level.
Despite views to the contrary , the rising carbon dioxide levels are cause for concern. If this warning sign goes
unheeded, we are in danger of turning back the climate clock to a time when humans did not roam this planet.

A Cultural Perspective on Time
Although the concept of time can be considered universal since it is (0) ....... by the laws of physics, some
people hold the view that language and culture can metaphorically divide us with regard to how we
perceive the passage of time. In the majority of Inda-European languages there is general consensus that
the past is behind us and the future lies ahead. However, unlike physics, this assumption is not universal. In
the Aymara culture, a conflicting set of temporal metaphors is in operation The Aymara picture themselves
rowing along in time, so their past is in front of them and their future is at their back. This perception is
reflected in their language as the literal translation of the phrase meaning a long time ago is 'a long time in
front of you'.
At first glance , this Aymara metaphor may appear strange, but the assertion actually fits in with our
experience of time, as we can see what has gone before but we cannot definitively see what is to come.
This specific example of what a tiny minority in South America has to offer in terms of understanding
the world we live in surely lends overwhelming support to the case for preserving cultural diversity.

Tactile Art Show
As humans develop through the various life stages (0) .......... the period from birth to death, they acquire
knowledge about the world around them through, among other things, sensory perception. Therefore,
one would be hard pressed to argue the fact that being born blind puts one at a disadvantage. The
unsighted baby ... child ... teen ... adult will have a different conception of shape, mass, size and colour
than their sighted counterparts It is common knowledge, however, that when a person is deprived of the
input obtained through one of the senses, the other senses become heightened in an effort to compensate
for the impeded sense. That being the case, touch becomes a crucial source of information to a visuallyimpaired
person. As illustrated by the Touch Art Fair, it can also pave the way for the unsighted to
appreciate art in all its glorious forms Said to be the first of its kind in the UK, the fair, a non-profit
organisation, seeks to redefine what it means to 'view' art.

Hollywoodland to Hollywood
When you think of Hollywood the primary image that springs to (0) ... is movies, of the big box office
variety But it is easy to forget that it has not always existed and, before its rise to prominence as the epicentre of
motion pictures, it was a distant unknown town with only a very small outpost for film. Back then, New York
was the centre of the movie-making industry, and it was not until a few independent studios had
established themselves that Hollywood started to have any relevance on the map.
There were a number of factors, though, that helped its success along in the early days. Los Angeles boasts
pretty much 365 days of sunshine, making it a paradise for filming. Moreover, there is a(n) abundance of natural
features providing a great variety of different locations in which to shoot films. Those physical factors,
coupled with the low price of property and the fact that there were no restrictions being imposed by movie
conglomerates, made it an independent film director's dream.
Soon film factories abounded and it was only a matter of time before a studio system was put in place to
ensure the quality of the movies produced. This system made it the movie centre not only of the US but of the
world and the European film industries are still, to this day, fighting to keep up.

Strengthening Company Culture
In this (0) .......... of hyper-connectivity, teleworking is easier than ever before, yet major companies seem
to be thinking twice about it. From a logistics point of view, this doesn't make sense: having fewer
employees on site equals lower costs and allowing staff to deal with practical or personal issues by
working from home increases productivity. For the discerning CEO, however, who's able to look at the
bigger picture, it also means a sharp decrease in the value each individual worker brings to the company
and the danger posed to the corporate identity .
The explanation is that gathering round the coffee vending machine is not perceived as idling or
skiving off work anymore, but as an opportunity to share information and bounce ideas off each other,
tap into colleagues' knowledge or get an alternative perspective. Much as it has been challenged
as a concept, workplace bonding is what ultimately encourages people to share in the company culture
and this is not something that can be done online.

Cheetah: not your average big cat
That the cheetah is the fastest of the big cats is beyond dispute and common (O) ...knowledge..
with it having reportedly been clocked at speeds in excess of 70mph. However. whilst it has impressive
acceleration over short distances. it could not conceivably sustain such speeds for any significant

the stamina department and generally have to abandon the chase.
Still on the subject of running. incredibly, a sprinting cheetah is actually completely

is an impressive seven metres.

Shark myth busted
Sharks undeniably have a very bad (O) ......... .. rap................. thanks to sensationalised stories in film and
the media; stories which cause them to be identified as dangerous. indiscriminate killers, prepared to hunt

Indeed. far from being the fearsome man eaters they are frequently depicted as. the
reverse is more often true and sharks are generally victims of humanity. For instance. millions are killed
annually for consumption in soup, leading to depleting shark numbers worldwide.
So, whilst sharks are undeniably food for humans. the reverse is seldom true. Sharks do not prey on people
per se, and the overwhelming majority of shark attacks are a case of mistaken identity
(Surfers. for instance. look remarkably similar in profile to seals from the depths of the ocean.

Besides. the majority of shark species are incapable of tackling prey the size of humans and instead feed
on small fish, or invertebrates such as squid or clams. Indeed. the impressive diversity ... .............. of
shark species is reflected in the fact that there are also many filter feeders. which dine on microscopic sea
life. such as plankton.
To put the figures in greater context there are over one hundred million sharks killed
by humans every year whilst there are typically fewer than ten shark-related human fatalities.

The problem is that whilst studies have shown that dogs are right about cancer more often than could
be explained by pure chance. their detection ..................................... rates are not high enough to make them reliable
for screening purposes. Besides, there already exist numerous cancer tests that are far more accurate and
effective for this purpose.
Therefore, sadly, whilst man's best friend undoubtedly has some very impressive tricks in his repertoire,
he will not be turning up in cancer units any time soon other than to comfort his loved ones in their
time of distress. This writer. for one. though. thinks that purpose is sufficiently meritorious in and of itself.

the (4 ) . ... . ... . .... . ....... cause of dispute was the barriers to communication present on account of the
lack of a common language. Therefore, he set out to create one: Esperanto.
His goals were incredibly ambitious, but was the new language a success? Well, in so far as it is the
most widely spoken artificial one in existence today, with an estimated two-plus-million people worldwide
fluent to some degree, you would have to say yes. However, the fact remains that Esperanto has not

so widely embraced .... ... . .... ... . . . as Zamenhof himself would have hoped.

Much hype accompanied the launch of the new route, but does it really live up to its billing .

Well, as the circular route skirts .. .................................... .. ... ...... the top-most part of the island. it certainly offers its

However. Van Gogh's struggles were not solely financial. His was a life full of turbulence .
and for most of it he was deeply unhappy and troubled. An aloof child. he was a disappointment to most of
his relatives. although he retained the support of his beloved brother. Theo. who financed
his training and development through most of his active years as an artist. Adulthood. however. would not
prove a happy phase of life for Van Gogh either: he was laid off from his first job as an art dealer. and. in his

Desperate to find his callin~ in life. he later became a minister and missionary, but this

Meeting Marvin Gaye

He spoke like he sang, in whisper-quiet melodies and soft falsettos. His conversation had a lyricism all of

- were more than made up for by his disarming sincerity. We became friends. I felt (S) .............. .

utterly slick - it took me a while to realise my hero was drowning.

A Message for Lisa
It was nearly two weeks later that Lisa arrived at college to find there was a message for her. The voice

rules.
The head office was on the third floor. Lisa's fantasies grew with each turn of the stairs. Each flap of
swing door (S) ............... sweeter and sweeter thoughts of her and Quentin's reconciliation.
It occurred to her only a second before she slid through into the dusty light of the office that
Quentin had no way of knowing that she was at college, and even if he did, it was unlikely he
would know which college she was at. 'Lisa.' The head of department was talking to her. 'Someone has
been looking for you.' Lisa's change of heart was so severe it took her breath away.

Horses·
Of the more than 4,000 species of mammals that have (0) .....D. ....... our earth over the past 10,000 years,
the horse is one of fewer than a dozen which have been successfully domesticated. Domestication is not
simply a matter of human intention. If it were, it is possible that we would now be sitting in our
fireside chairs with a hyena curled at our feet.
Much of what we take for granted as useful in the modern horse - speed, size and intelligence,
for example - can be explained through the evolutionary changes it has undergone in response to a
changing diet. As the Ice Age advanced and forests died away, to be replaced by windswept
savannah, many herbivores were compelled to change their diets from leaves to grass. The little
leaf-browsing predecessor of our modern horse - the ur-horse - began to change and adapt to a
new ecological niche on the plains. The head grew longer, with the eye positioned at some
distance from the mouth, so that in exposed spaces it could keep a careful lookout for
predators while it grazed. A larger brain began to develop, probably because, as a grazer, it needed
greater tactile sensitivity in its lips to choose its food.

consensus of opinion seemed to indicate that its main weakness lay in its apparent 'lack of
plot'.
