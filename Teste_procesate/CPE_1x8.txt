The history of television
Few inventions have (1)......... more scorn and praise (2)......... them at the same time than television.
And few have done so much to unite the world into one vast audience for news, sport, information and
entertainment. Television must be (3)......... alongside printing as one of the most significant inventions
of all time in the (4)......... of communications. In just a few decades it has reached (5)......... every
home in the developed world and an ever-increasing proportion of homes in developing countries. It
took over half a century from the first suggestion that television might be possible before the first
(6)......... pictures were produced in laboratories in Britain and America.
In 1926 John Logie Baird's genius for publicity brought television to the (7)......... of a British audience.
It has since (8)......... such heights of success and taken on such a pivotal function that it is difficult to
imagine a world (9)......... of this groundbreaking invention.

Pregnancy - a time to forget
Anecdotal reports (0) that heavily pregnant women and new mothers (1) have been (2) up by a
study that has found that the ability to memorise information drops significantly in the last three months
of pregnancy.
The findings of the study were reported yesterday to the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in
New Orleans by Dr Pamela Keenan, assistant professor of psychiatry at Wayne State University and
Detroit Medical Centre.
In a study into the "benign encephalopathy of pregnancy", Dr Keenan (3)......... memory tests on 19
pregnant women and found that the ability to (4)......... information declined during pregnancy. Expressed
in (5)......... of the amount of information that could be remembered, it declined from 49 percent in the
first trimester, to 47 percent in the second, to 39 percent in the third. Shortly, after birth the study partici-
pants were able to recall 37 percent of the information.
It was noted that after a period of approximately three months, the studied revealed that new mums'
memories return to a relative (6)......... of normality. Other studies have since been carried out on more
subjects revealing more (7)......... evidence that pregnancy does indeed contribute to memory-loss. But, then
again, there are also health (8)......... to life with a bun in the oven.

The Sinking of the Titanic
All in (0) of the Titanic had received six ice warnings; it was quite clear that the Titanic was steaming
towards ice. At 11:40 pm many of the stewards were turning down the lights and cleaning the Titanic's
public rooms, and the last of the social (1)......... were making their way to their cabins. In the crow's nest,
Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee struggled to (2)......... what was in the haze - for some (3).........
reason, binoculars were not in the nest. Suddenly Fleet jerked the warning bell three times and
telephoned the bridge and sputtered, "Iceberg dead (4)........." into the receiver. "Thank you", Sixth
Officer Moody replied. The Titanic was a collision (5)......... with a huge iceberg and the officers in
the crow's nest (6)......... themselves for impact. The worst part is what happened to the people
onboard. The ship was one of the most luxurious liners of all time, but it wasn't (7)......... with enough
lifeboats for all the passengers, so many died that night and in the (8)......... hours of the following morning.

Brain Gel
A gel that helps brains recover from (1)......... injuries has been developed by scientists at the Clemson
University in South Carolina. The gel, which is (2)......... in liquid form at the site where the injury was
sustained, (3)......... stem cell growth in the affected area. In terms of circumstances in which it might be
applied, the gel has the potential to treat a wide range of head injuries, including those arising from car
accidents, falls and gunshot wounds.
Serious brain injuries are particularly difficult to recover from on account of the fact that the affected tissue
can swell up considerably, which causes additional (4)......... damage to the surrounding cells. Existing treat-
ments do little more than attempt to limit secondary damage and are relatively (5)......... certainly when it
comes to repairing the damaged cells, so the discovery of a gel which stimulates cell repair is being
(6)......... as revolutionary.
Despite the wave of excitement now running through medical circles, it is important to note that results
so far are (7)......... solely on observations of the effects of the gel on laboratory rats. The development of
the treatment is very much still in its (8)......... stages and human testing is expected to be some three
years or more away yet.

birds.
Dinosaur fossils were first discovered here nearly a century and a half ago, but large scale (6)......... did not

Higgs Boson
July 4th is fairly (0)......... with the celebration of American independence. However, it is also now the day

Iconic Symbol Lost to Galapagos Forever
The news of the demise of Lonesome George, (0)......... to be the last-surviving member of his species,
Geochelone abingdoni, is unlikely to come as a shock to those who (1)......... the fortunes of Galapagos, the
habitat that inspired the Darwinian theory of evolution, and one that is now genuinely under real threat and in
danger of being (2)......... harmed by human activity, with the main source of damage being tourism.
Early visitors to the archipelago were what could be (3)......... true nature-loving tourists, a group which did
little collective or individual harm to the islands and did not interfere with the fragile balance of the ecosystem.
However, in more recent times, eco-tourism has grown to enjoy almost cult-like popularity. Eco-tourists harm a
very different beast though and are rather more (4)......... in their nature. Therefore, while, on the (5).........

standing that their comfort will not be sacrificed, requiring tour providers to take special measures to accom-
modate their more discerning tastes.

their popularity with visitors is assisting local operators, a proportion of whose revenue goes towards the
upkeep and conservation of the precious ecosystem. Sadly, the large international tour companies are far less
benevolent with the (7)......... of their activities, which results in a double-edged sword situation whereby, due

less funding is being made available to conserve the ecosystem.

A LANGUAGE EXPERIMENT
Language is thought to be a(n) (0)......... for transmitting the information within thoughts. One experi-
ment used to demonstrate this idea (1)......... subjects to listen to a short passage of several sen-
tences, then to repeat the passage. Most people will accurately convey the (2)......... of the passage in
the sentences they produce, but will not come close to repeating the sentences verbatim. It appears
that two (3)......... are occurring. Upon hearing the passage, the subjects convert the language of the
passage into a more abstract representation of its meaning, which is more easily (4)......... within
memory. Then in order to recreate the passage, the subject (5)......... this representation and converts its
meaning back into language.
This separation of thought and language is less intuitive than it might be because language can be a
powerful (6)......... with which to manipulate thoughts. It provides a mechanism to internally
rehearse, critique and (7)......... thoughts. This internal form of communication is (8)......... for a
social animal and could certainly be, in part, responsible for the strong selective pressures for
improved language use.
