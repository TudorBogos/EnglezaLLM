opportunities. And (3) .... some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have (4) .... ,

Putting Pen to Paper
Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it (7) .... that this is because of

Supermarket Opening
The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely

Climate and Weather
Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, profoundly affect the lives
and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a dominating force on the character of
landscapes. For example, warmth and wetness all the year round allow the growth of tropical
jungles, which are natural (7) .... troves, with an incredible diversity of species. (8) .... cold,
windswept areas can muster only a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns
that (9) .... up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing,
for the atmosphere is never still. Some of the motion is (10) .... the fact that the envelope of gases
rests on a spinning globe; because air is thin it is not dragged along at the same speed as the
earth, but tends to (11) .... behind. A more important (12) .... of turbulence, or air movement,

Coffee
My duties as bar-person included serving drinks but, more worryingly, I was to be responsible for

I learnt, too, about the essential principles (15) .... in making the perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino.
By the end of the first week I had to admit that making a decent cup of coffee was not as easy as
it looked and I (16) .... expected to be (17) .... to lowly ash-tray wiping duties again. Luckily, my

Othello and Desdemona but I eat my (2) .... about the rest of Mr Fearon's magnificent performance.

Young Readers
Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would
be worthy; and for 'worthy', (7) .... 'boring', we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our
father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us (8) ....
our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would (9) .... the odd superior book in

Literature'. Though we (10) .. .. mast of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, (11) / .. us

Language
'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous,' wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The
marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. 'Primitive man was likely to make
sounds like "meuh" when (13) .... danger,' claimed Charles Caller in 1928. "'Meuh" has a plaintive
sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts (14) '. 1/.
desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria
meaning "fever" or the Latin mars meaning "death".'
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic; regarding it as a playground for cranks,
but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably
developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. (15) .... , speech was used for friendly
interaction, and was an important tool in power (16) .... . Information-swapping was probably not an
important original (17) .... - contrary to the views of philosopher John Locke, who spoke of language
as a 'great conduit' for (18) .. .. knowledge.

For Paul Simon, as for other youngsters in the US, the chief (4) .... for hearing this new and

for producing an increasing variety of clothing and physical adornment have been discovered, so
the meanings attached to dress have also increased in their complexity and significance.
Consequently, it is difficult to say with any (5) .... of certainty today what any item of clothing or
adornment actually means. For example, a man's suit, (6) .... an indicator of the most extreme
uniformity, actually conveys very differing meanings in different contexts and to different people.

Writer
Newspaper reports of publishers in (7) .... wars over whizz-kid manuscripts have resulted in a skewed

Sudden Fame
The small (13) .... we were performing at around the country were all beginning to sell (14) .... and
extra bouncers were having to be called in to hold back the growing legion of screaming girls. We
found ourselves having to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms we were playing
to prevent ourselves being mobbed by fans. On the few nights a week when we were not working,
we found it difficult to leave the house without being pursued through the streets by adoring
followers. In a (15) .... of days, we had been transformed into celebrities. Our moves were monitored
by our admirers and all of our needs (16) .... for by our management and other interested parties.
Even though the shyness that had always accompanied me never quite went away, it was replaced

Citizen Kane
When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its (1) ....
- delayed because of distributors' fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its (2) .... subject,
might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television
that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has
inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles's
first film. Welles always (3) .... that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or
wasn't allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his (4) .... ,
cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard
Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz (5) .. .. on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate

as director and actor, and (6) .... his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had (8) .... her head amiably and distantly as if she
hadn't really heard or understood.
'Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?' he had asked.
She had smiled. 'Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn't anything to do all day
so I was going to (9) .... downtown and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful
thing, just (10) .... away the day.'
Dermot had smiled back. 'You're (11) ... . to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I'm late I won't want

Title Race
Tea boy? Do you mind, I'm a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.
Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. (13) .. .. a recent study which has informed the
nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of
recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create

Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to (15) .... a pay rise
in favour of a more 'motivational' or 'professional' job title. If our vanity is (16) .... such proportions
that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.
The truth is that in these brave new days of the early twenty-first century, nobody is content to be

coordinator) but are, in fact, little more than euphemisms.

Amateur Astronomy
Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there
was a great (1) .... of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few
books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers
almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised
almanacs and chart production, and (2) .... the analysis of observations and the publication of
results.
All this must surely make this the golden (3) .... of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great
deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found
in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now (4) .... by aircraft condensation trails which
can (5) .... for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations
impossible and (6) .... night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice
Society is becoming 'overchoiced'. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many
opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an
addiction, and technology simply accelerates the (7) .... of change: the noise, the (8) .... of new
goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off
this virtual production line than the next one is about to be (9) ..... The head spins, the brain races,
the fatigue (10) .... ; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more
complexity. Hence a new trend is (11) ..... The search is on for 'simplexity' - the simple things that
give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simpl'i fying your life is not easy in an age of
economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever
need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep (12) .... of.

McAndrews Hotel
Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family
tradition, (13) .... by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is
allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd
perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants
which (14) .... for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who
sometimes appear to (15) .... themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most
of my fellow-guests' names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet
can {16) .... assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social

Photography
When a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is
(1) .... by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a
(2) .... of social and cultural norms. And in the (3) .... of this book we shall see how these factors not
only affect the style, content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are
perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the (4) .... reader
of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the
page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face (5) .... , we might question whether it
accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it
communicate the photographer's point of view? Is it the (6) .... instant recorded that is of particular
importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state
of affairs in the world?

More than a game
Sport for me has always been more than just a game. The most successful people in sport have
total self-belief. You need tunnel (7) .... if you want to succeed in sport. There's only one route to
being the best and you have to put everything else to one (8) ..... Sport is ruthless and no one else
is going to do it for you. It's sink or (9) .....
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of
working as one of a team. My sport allows and encourages you to (10) .... individually, yet it is a
team game and you have to balance these two aspects. It's very much like life - you can succeed
as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Sport has given me a great deal - and not just financially. It has opened (11) .... for me and opened
my eyes, and I've seen things around the world that others will never see. But you also have to give
up a lot for those (12) .....

Tuning in
Some experiences (13) .... themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity

(15) .... in one of the tall trees that were (16) .... around the suburban neighbourhood. I don't suffer
from insomnia - it was the exquisite artistry of the singer that kept me awake. As I followed his
intricately woven melodies, I found myself (17) .... into an unexpected aesthetic environment. In
order to follow the patterns that issued from the bird, I had to call on my experience of jazz and Indian
classical music. The bird had me (18) .... that I was being treated to an ad lib performance of the
most breathtaking improvisational acrobatics. I groaned and I cheered as one improbable musical
variation followed another through the open window where I lay listening, until finally I fell asleep.
